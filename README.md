  # Description
  ##### [Back to Table of Contents](#Table-of-Contents)
  This application required creation of a web server using the Express.js framework that would be added to a front-end application that the local zoo is developing, called Zoo Keepr. The site’s data now lives on the server that is built so that anyone can access it without having to download it. I have learned how Express.js framework is created and used. This has been a great journey of learning that I am taking with me and intend to build on.

  ## User Story
  ##### [Back to Table of Contents](#Table-of-Contents)
  The local zoo has received funding to build a new online catalog, and they've asked for creation of a web server for a front-end application they’re developing, called Zoo Keepr. This site’s data will be stored on the server that is created. This will allow animal enthusiasts to access the data from different locations and browsers without needing to download it to their device.
